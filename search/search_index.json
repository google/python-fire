Simply write the functionality you want exposed at the command line as a function / module / class, and then call Fire. With this addition of a single-line call to Fire, your CLI is ready to go. Develop and debug Python code When you're writing a Python library, you probably want to try it out as you go. You could write a main method to check the functionality you're interested in, but then you have to change the main method with every new experiment you're interested in testing, and constantly updating the main method is a hassle. You could also open an IPython REPL and import your library there and test it, but then you have to deal with reloading your imports every time you change something. If you simply call Fire in your library, then you can run all of it's functionality from the command line without having to keep making changes to a main method.

Python Fire is a Python library that will turn any Python component into a command line interface with just a single call to Fire . Let's get started! Installation To install Python Fire from pypi, run: pip install fire Alternatively, to install Python Fire from source, clone the source and run: python setup.py install Hello World Version 1: fire.Fire() The easiest way to use Fire is to take any Python program, and then simply call fire.Fire() at the end of the program. This will expose the full contents of the program to the command line. import fire def hello(name): return 'Hello {name}!'.format(name=name) if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire() Here's how we can run our program from the command line: $ python example.py hello World Hello World! Version 2: fire.Fire(<fn>) Let's modify our program slightly to only expose the hello function to the command line. import fire def hello(name): return 'Hello {name}!'.format(name=name) if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire(hello) Here's how we can run this from the command line: $ python example.py World Hello World! Notice we no longer have to specify to run the hello function, because we called fire.Fire(hello) . Version 3: Using a main We can alternatively write this program like this: import fire def hello(name): return 'Hello {name}!'.format(name=name) def main(): fire.Fire(hello) if __name__ == '__main__': main() Or if we're using entry points , then simply this: import fire def hello(name): return 'Hello {name}!'.format(name=name) def main(): fire.Fire(hello) Version 4: Fire Without Code Changes If you have a file example.py that doesn't even import fire: def hello(name): return 'Hello {name}!'.format(name=name) Then you can use it with Fire like this: $ python -m fire example hello --name=World Hello World! You can also specify the filepath of example.py rather than its module path, like so: $ python -m fire example.py hello --name=World Hello World! Exposing Multiple Commands In the previous example, we exposed a single function to the command line. Now we'll look at ways of exposing multiple functions to the command line. Version 1: fire.Fire() The simplest way to expose multiple commands is to write multiple functions, and then call Fire. import fire def add(x, y): return x + y def multiply(x, y): return x * y if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire() We can use this like so: $ python example.py add 10 20 30 $ python example.py multiply 10 20 200 You'll notice that Fire correctly parsed 10 and 20 as numbers, rather than as strings. Read more about argument parsing here . Version 2: fire.Fire(<dict>) In version 1 we exposed all the program's functionality to the command line. By using a dict, we can selectively expose functions to the command line. import fire def add(x, y): return x + y def multiply(x, y): return x * y if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire({ 'add': add, 'multiply': multiply, }) We can use this in the same way as before: $ python example.py add 10 20 30 $ python example.py multiply 10 20 200 Version 3: fire.Fire(<object>) Fire also works on objects, as in this variant. This is a good way to expose multiple commands. import fire class Calculator(object): def add(self, x, y): return x + y def multiply(self, x, y): return x * y if __name__ == '__main__': calculator = Calculator() fire.Fire(calculator) We can use this in the same way as before: $ python example.py add 10 20 30 $ python example.py multiply 10 20 200 Version 4: fire.Fire(<class>) Fire also works on classes. This is another good way to expose multiple commands. import fire class Calculator(object): def add(self, x, y): return x + y def multiply(self, x, y): return x * y if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire(Calculator) We can use this in the same way as before: $ python example.py add 10 20 30 $ python example.py multiply 10 20 200 Why might you prefer a class over an object? One reason is that you can pass arguments for constructing the class too, as in this broken calculator example. import fire class BrokenCalculator(object): def __init__(self, offset=1): self._offset = offset def add(self, x, y): return x + y + self._offset def multiply(self, x, y): return x * y + self._offset if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire(BrokenCalculator) When you use a broken calculator, you get wrong answers: $ python example.py add 10 20 31 $ python example.py multiply 10 20 201 But you can always fix it: $ python example.py add 10 20 --offset=0 30 $ python example.py multiply 10 20 --offset=0 200 Unlike calling ordinary functions, which can be done both with positional arguments and named arguments (--flag syntax), arguments to __init__ functions must be passed with the --flag syntax. See the section on calling functions for more. Grouping Commands Here's an example of how you might make a command line interface with grouped commands. class IngestionStage(object): def run(self): return 'Ingesting! Nom nom nom...' class DigestionStage(object): def run(self, volume=1): return ' '.join(['Burp!'] * volume) def status(self): return 'Satiated.' class Pipeline(object): def __init__(self): self.ingestion = IngestionStage() self.digestion = DigestionStage() def run(self): ingestion_output = self.ingestion.run() digestion_output = self.digestion.run() return [ingestion_output, digestion_output] if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire(Pipeline) Here's how this looks at the command line: $ python example.py run Ingesting! Nom nom nom... Burp! $ python example.py ingestion run Ingesting! Nom nom nom... $ python example.py digestion run Burp! $ python example.py digestion status Satiated. You can nest your commands in arbitrarily complex ways, if you're feeling grumpy or adventurous. Accessing Properties In the examples we've looked at so far, our invocations of python example.py have all run some function from the example program. In this example, we simply access a property. from airports import airports import fire class Airport(object): def __init__(self, code): self.code = code self.name = dict(airports).get(self.code) self.city = self.name.split(',')[0] if self.name else None if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire(Airport) Now we can use this program to learn about airport codes! $ python example.py --code=JFK code JFK $ python example.py --code=SJC name San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA - Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International (SJC) $ python example.py --code=ALB city Albany-Schenectady-Troy By the way, you can find this airports module here . Chaining Function Calls When you run a Fire CLI, you can take all the same actions on the result of the call to Fire that you can take on the original object passed in. For example, we can use our Airport CLI from the previous example like this: $ python example.py --code=ALB city upper ALBANY-SCHENECTADY-TROY This works since upper is a method on all strings. So, if you want to set up your functions to chain nicely, all you have to do is have a class whose methods return self. Here's an example. import fire class BinaryCanvas(object): \"\"\"A canvas with which to make binary art, one bit at a time.\"\"\" def __init__(self, size=10): self.pixels = [[0] * size for _ in range(size)] self._size = size self._row = 0 # The row of the cursor. self._col = 0 # The column of the cursor. def __str__(self): return '\\n'.join(' '.join(str(pixel) for pixel in row) for row in self.pixels) def show(self): print(self) return self def move(self, row, col): self._row = row % self._size self._col = col % self._size return self def on(self): return self.set(1) def off(self): return self.set(0) def set(self, value): self.pixels[self._row][self._col] = value return self if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire(BinaryCanvas) Now we can draw stuff :). $ python example.py move 3 3 on move 3 6 on move 6 3 on move 6 6 on move 7 4 on move 7 5 on 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 It's supposed to be a smiley face. Custom Serialization You'll notice in the BinaryCanvas example, the canvas with the smiley face was printed to the screen. You can determine how a component will be serialized by defining its __str__ method. If a custom __str__ method is present on the final component, the object is serialized and printed. If there's no custom __str__ method, then the help screen for the object is shown instead. Can we make an even simpler example than Hello World? Yes, this program is even simpler than our original Hello World example. import fire english = 'Hello World' spanish = 'Hola Mundo' fire.Fire() You can use it like this: $ python example.py english Hello World $ python example.py spanish Hola Mundo Calling Functions Arguments to a constructor are passed by name using flag syntax --name=value . For example, consider this simple class: import fire class Building(object): def __init__(self, name, stories=1): self.name = name self.stories = stories def climb_stairs(self, stairs_per_story=10): for story in range(self.stories): for stair in range(1, stairs_per_story): yield stair yield 'Phew!' yield 'Done!' if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire(Building) We can instantiate it as follows: python example.py --name=\"Sherrerd Hall\" Arguments to other functions may be passed positionally or by name using flag syntax. To instantiate a Building and then run the climb_stairs function, the following commands are all valid: $ python example.py --name=\"Sherrerd Hall\" --stories=3 climb_stairs 10 $ python example.py --name=\"Sherrerd Hall\" climb_stairs --stairs_per_story=10 $ python example.py --name=\"Sherrerd Hall\" climb_stairs --stairs-per-story 10 $ python example.py climb-stairs --stairs-per-story 10 --name=\"Sherrerd Hall\" You'll notice that hyphens and underscores ( - and _ ) are interchangeable in member names and flag names. You'll also notice that the constructor's arguments can come after the function's arguments or before the function. You'll also notice that the equal sign between the flag name and its value is optional. Functions with *varargs and **kwargs Fire supports functions that take *varargs or **kwargs. Here's an example: import fire def order_by_length(*items): \"\"\"Orders items by length, breaking ties alphabetically.\"\"\" sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: (len(str(item)), str(item))) return ' '.join(sorted_items) if __name__ == '__main__': fire.Fire(order_by_length) To use it, we run: $ python example.py dog cat elephant cat dog elephant You can use a separator to indicate that you're done providing arguments to a function. All arguments after the separator will be used to process the result of the function, rather than being passed to the function itself. The default separator is the hyphen - . Here's an example where we use a separator. $ python example.py dog cat elephant - upper CAT DOG ELEPHANT Without the separator, upper would have been treated as another argument. $ python example.py dog cat elephant upper cat dog upper elephant You can change the separator with the --separator flag. Flags are always separated from your Fire command by an isolated -- . Here's an example where we change the separator. $ python example.py dog cat elephant X upper -- --separator=X CAT DOG ELEPHANT Separators can be useful when a function accepts *varargs, **kwargs, or default values that you don't want to specify. It is also important to remember to change the separator if you want to pass - as an argument. Argument Parsing The types of the arguments are determined by their values, rather than by the function signature where they're used. You can pass any Python literal from the command line: numbers, strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, (sets are only supported in some versions of Python). You can also nest the collections arbitrarily as long as they only contain literals. To demonstrate this, we'll make a small example program that tells us the type of any argument we give it: import fire fire.Fire(lambda obj: type(obj).__name__) And we'll use it like so: $ python example.py 10 int $ python example.py 10.0 float $ python example.py hello str $ python example.py '(1,2)' tuple $ python example.py [1,2] list $ python example.py True bool $ python example.py {name:David} dict You'll notice in that last example that bare-words are automatically replaced with strings. Be careful with your quotes! If you want to pass the string \"10\" , rather than the int 10 , you'll need to either escape or quote your quotes. Otherwise Bash will eat your quotes and pass an unquoted 10 to your Python program, where Fire will interpret it as a number. $ python example.py 10 int $ python example.py \"10\" int $ python example.py '\"10\"' str $ python example.py \"'10'\" str $ python example.py \\\"10\\\" str Be careful with your quotes! Remember that Bash processes your arguments first, and then Fire parses the result of that. If you wanted to pass the dict {\"name\": \"David Bieber\"} to your program, you might try this: $ python example.py '{\"name\": \"David Bieber\"}' # Good! Do this. dict $ python example.py {\"name\":'\"David Bieber\"'} # Okay. dict $ python example.py {\"name\":\"David Bieber\"} # Wrong. This is parsed as a string. str $ python example.py {\"name\": \"David Bieber\"} # Wrong. This isn't even treated as a single argument. <error> $ python example.py '{\"name\": \"Justin Bieber\"}' # Wrong. This is not the Bieber you're looking for. (The syntax is fine though :)) dict Boolean Arguments The tokens True and False are parsed as boolean values. You may also specify booleans via flag syntax --name and --noname , which set name to True and False respectively. Continuing the previous example, we could run any of the following: $ python example.py --obj=True bool $ python example.py --obj=False bool $ python example.py --obj bool $ python example.py --noobj bool Be careful with boolean flags! If a token other than another flag immediately follows a flag that's supposed to be a boolean, the flag will take on the value of the token rather than the boolean value. You can resolve this: by putting a separator after your last flag, by explicitly stating the value of the boolean flag (as in --obj=True ), or by making sure there's another flag after any boolean flag argument. Using Fire Flags Fire CLIs all come with a number of flags. These flags should be separated from the Fire command by an isolated -- . If there is at least one isolated -- argument, then arguments after the final isolated -- are treated as flags, whereas all arguments before the final isolated -- are considered part of the Fire command. One useful flag is the --interactive flag. Use the --interactive flag on any CLI to enter a Python REPL with all the modules and variables used in the context where Fire was called already available to you for use. Other useful variables, such as the result of the Fire command will also be available. Use this feature like this: python example.py -- --interactive . You can add the help flag to any command to see help and usage information. Fire incorporates your docstrings into the help and usage information that it generates. Fire will try to provide help even if you omit the isolated -- separating the flags from the Fire command, but may not always be able to, since help is a valid argument name. Use this feature like this: python example.py -- --help or python example.py --help (or even python example.py -h ). The complete set of flags available is shown below, in the reference section.

Arguments for Calling fire.Fire() Argument Usage Notes component fire.Fire(component) If omitted, defaults to a dict of all locals and globals. command fire.Fire(command='hello --name=5') Either a string or a list of arguments. If a string is provided, it is split to determine the arguments. If a list or tuple is provided, they are the arguments. If command is omitted, then sys.argv[1:] (the arguments from the command line) are used by default. name fire.Fire(name='tool') The name of the CLI, ideally the name users will enter to run the CLI. This name will be used in the CLI's help screens. If the argument is omitted, it will be inferred automatically. serialize fire.Fire(serialize=custom_serializer) If omitted, simple types are serialized via their builtin str method, and any objects that define a custom __str__ method are serialized with that. If specified, all objects are serialized to text via the provided method.

The simplest Fire command consists of running your program with no additional arguments. This command corresponds to the Python component you called the Fire function on. If you did not supply an object in the call to Fire , then the context in which Fire was called will be used as the Python component. You can append --help or -h to a command to see what Python component it corresponds to, as well as the various ways in which you can extend the command. Flags to Fire should be separated from the Fire command by an isolated -- in order to distinguish between flags and named arguments. So, for example, to enter interactive mode append -- -i or -- --interactive to any command. To use Fire in verbose mode, append -- --verbose . Given a Fire command that corresponds to a Python object, you can extend that command to access a member of that object, call it with arguments if it is a function, instantiate it if it is a class, or index into it if it is a list. Read on to learn about how you can write a Fire command corresponding to whatever Python component you're looking for. Accessing members of an object If your command corresponds to an object, you can extend your command by adding the name of a member of that object as a new argument to the command. The resulting command will correspond to that member. For example, if the object your command corresponds to has a method defined on it named 'whack', then you can add the argument 'whack' to your command, and the resulting new command corresponds to the whack method. As another example, if the object your command corresponds to has a property named high_score, then you can add the argument 'high-score' to your command, and the resulting new command corresponds to the value of the high_score property. Accessing members of a dict If your command corresponds to a dict, you can extend your command by adding the name of one of the dict's keys as an argument. For example, widget function-that-returns-dict key will correspond to the value of the item with key key in the dict returned by function_that_returns_dict . Accessing members of a list or tuple If your command corresponds to a list or tuple, you can extend your command by adding the index of an element of the component to your command as an argument. For example, widget function-that-returns-list 2 will correspond to item 2 of the result of function_that_returns_list . Calling a function If your command corresponds to a function, you can extend your command by adding the arguments of this function. Arguments can be specified positionally, or by name. To specify an argument by name, use flag syntax. For example, suppose your command corresponds to the function double : def double(value=0): return 2 * value Then you can extend your command using named arguments as command --value 5 , or using positional arguments as command 5 . In both cases, the new command corresponds to the result of the function, in this case the number 10. You can force a function that takes a variable number of arguments to be evaluated by adding a separator (the default separator is the hyphen, \"-\"). This will prevent arguments to the right of the separator from being consumed for calling the function. This is useful if the function has arguments with default values, or if the function accepts *varargs, or if the function accepts **kwargs. See also the section on Changing the Separator . Instantiating a class If your command corresponds to a class, you can extend your command by adding the arguments of the class's __init__ function. Arguments must be specified by name, using the flags syntax. See the section on calling a function for more details. Similarly, when passing arguments to a callable object (an object with a custom __call__ function), those arguments must be passed using flags syntax. Using Flags with Fire CLIs Command line arguments to a Fire CLI are normally consumed by Fire, as described in the Basic Usage section. In order to set Flags, put the flags after the final standalone -- argument. (If there is no -- argument, then no arguments are used for flags.) For example, to set the alsologtostderr flag, you could run the command: widget bang --noise=boom -- --alsologtostderr . The --noise argument is consumed by Fire, but the --alsologtostderr argument is treated as a normal Flag. All CLIs built with Python Fire share some flags, as described in the next sections. Python Fire's Flags As described in the Using Flags section, you must add an isolated -- argument in order to have arguments treated as Flags rather than be consumed by Python Fire. All arguments to a Fire CLI after the final standalone -- argument are treated as Flags. The following flags are accepted by all Fire CLIs: --interactive / -i , --help / -h , --separator , --completion , --trace , and --verbose / -v , as described in the following sections. --interactive : Interactive mode Call widget -- --interactive or widget -- -i to enter interactive mode. This will put you in an IPython REPL, with the variable widget already defined. You can then explore the Python object that widget corresponds to interactively using Python. Note: if you want fire to start the IPython REPL instead of the regular Python one, the ipython package needs to be installed in your environment. --completion : Generating a completion script Call widget -- --completion to generate a completion script for the Fire CLI widget . To save the completion script to your home directory, you could e.g. run widget -- --completion > ~/.widget-completion . You should then source this file; to get permanent completion, source this file from your .bashrc file. Call widget -- --completion fish to generate a completion script for the Fish shell. Source this file from your fish.config. If the commands available in the Fire CLI change, you'll have to regenerate the completion script and source it again. --help : Getting help Let say you have a command line tool named widget that was made with Fire. How do you use this Fire CLI? The simplest way to get started is to run widget -- --help . This will give you usage information for your CLI. You can always append -- --help to any Fire command in order to get usage information for that command and any subcommands. Additionally, help will be displayed if you hit an error using Fire. For example, if you try to pass too many or too few arguments to a function, then help will be displayed. Similarly, if you try to access a member that does not exist, or if you index into a list with too high an index, then help will be displayed. The displayed help shows information about which Python component your command corresponds to, as well as usage information for how to extend that command. --trace : Getting a Fire trace In order to understand what is happening when you call Python Fire, it can be useful to request a trace. This is done via the --trace flag, e.g. widget whack 5 -- --trace . A trace provides step by step information about how the Fire command was executed. In includes which actions were taken, starting with the initial component, leading to the final component represented by the command. A trace is also shown alongside the help if your Fire command reaches an error. --separator : Changing the separator As described in Calling a Function , you can use a separator argument when writing a command that corresponds to calling a function. The separator will cause the function to be evaluated or the class to be instantiated using only the arguments left of the separator. Arguments right of the separator will then be applied to the result of the function call or to the instantiated object. The default separator is - . If you want to supply the string \"-\" as an argument, then you will have to change the separator. You can choose a new separator by supplying the --separator flag to Fire. Here's an example to demonstrate separator usage. Let's say you have a function that takes a variable number of args, and you want to call that function, and then upper case the result. Here's how to do it: # Here's the Python function def display(arg1, arg2='!'): return arg1 + arg2 # Here's what you can do from Bash (Note: the default separator is the hyphen -) display hello # hello! display hello upper # helloupper display hello - upper # HELLO! display - SEP upper -- --separator SEP # -! Notice how in the third and fourth lines, the separator caused the display function to be called with the default value for arg2. In the fourth example, we change the separator to the string \"SEP\" so that we can pass '-' as an argument. --verbose : Verbose usage Adding the -v or --verbose flag turns on verbose mode. This will eg reveal private members in the usage string. Often these members will not actually be usable from the command line tool. As such, verbose mode should be considered a debugging tool, but not fully supported yet.","title":"Using a CLI"},{"location":"using-cli/#using-a-fire-cli","text":"","title":"Using a Fire CLI"},{"location":"using-cli/#basic-usage","text":"Every Fire command corresponds to a Python component.

The resulting command will correspond to that member. For example, if the object your command corresponds to has a method defined on it named 'whack', then you can add the argument 'whack' to your command, and the resulting new command corresponds to the whack method. As another example, if the object your command corresponds to has a property named high_score, then you can add the argument 'high-score' to your command, and the resulting new command corresponds to the value of the high_score property.","title":"Accessing members of an object"},{"location":"using-cli/#accessing-members-of-a-dict","text":"If your command corresponds to a dict, you can extend your command by adding the name of one of the dict's keys as an argument. For example, widget function-that-returns-dict key will correspond to the value of the item with key key in the dict returned by function_that_returns_dict .","title":"Accessing members of a dict"},{"location":"using-cli/#accessing-members-of-a-list-or-tuple","text":"If your command corresponds to a list or tuple, you can extend your command by adding the index of an element of the component to your command as an argument. For example, widget function-that-returns-list 2 will correspond to item 2 of the result of function_that_returns_list .","title":"Accessing members of a list or tuple"},{"location":"using-cli/#calling-a-function","text":"If your command corresponds to a function, you can extend your command by adding the arguments of this function. Arguments can be specified positionally, or by name. To specify an argument by name, use flag syntax. For example, suppose your command corresponds to the function double : def double(value=0): return 2 * value Then you can extend your command using named arguments as command --value 5 , or using positional arguments as command 5 . In both cases, the new command corresponds to the result of the function, in this case the number 10. You can force a function that takes a variable number of arguments to be evaluated by adding a separator (the default separator is the hyphen, \"-\"). This will prevent arguments to the right of the separator from being consumed for calling the function. This is useful if the function has arguments with default values, or if the function accepts *varargs, or if the function accepts **kwargs. See also the section on Changing the Separator .","title":"Calling a function"},{"location":"using-cli/#instantiating-a-class","text":"If your command corresponds to a class, you can extend your command by adding the arguments of the class's __init__ function. Arguments must be specified by name, using the flags syntax. See the section on calling a function for more details. Similarly, when passing arguments to a callable object (an object with a custom __call__ function), those arguments must be passed using flags syntax.","title":"Instantiating a class"},{"location":"using-cli/#using-flags-with-fire-clis","text":"Command line arguments to a Fire CLI are normally consumed by Fire, as described in the Basic Usage section. In order to set Flags, put the flags after the final standalone -- argument. (If there is no -- argument, then no arguments are used for flags.) For example, to set the alsologtostderr flag, you could run the command: widget bang --noise=boom -- --alsologtostderr . The --noise argument is consumed by Fire, but the --alsologtostderr argument is treated as a normal Flag. All CLIs built with Python Fire share some flags, as described in the next sections.","title":"Using Flags with Fire CLIs "},{"location":"using-cli/#python-fires-flags","text":"As described in the Using Flags section, you must add an isolated -- argument in order to have arguments treated as Flags rather than be consumed by Python Fire. All arguments to a Fire CLI after the final standalone -- argument are treated as Flags. The following flags are accepted by all Fire CLIs: --interactive / -i , --help / -h , --separator , --completion , --trace , and --verbose / -v , as described in the following sections.","title":"Python Fire's Flags"},{"location":"using-cli/#-interactive-interactive-mode","text":"Call widget -- --interactive or widget -- -i to enter interactive mode. This will put you in an IPython REPL, with the variable widget already defined. You can then explore the Python object that widget corresponds to interactively using Python. Note: if you want fire to start the IPython REPL instead of the regular Python one, the ipython package needs to be installed in your environment.","title":"--interactive: Interactive mode "},{"location":"using-cli/#-completion-generating-a-completion-script","text":"Call widget -- --completion to generate a completion script for the Fire CLI widget . To save the completion script to your home directory, you could e.g. run widget -- --completion > ~/.widget-completion . You should then source this file; to get permanent completion, source this file from your .bashrc file. Call widget -- --completion fish to generate a completion script for the Fish shell. Source this file from your fish.config. If the commands available in the Fire CLI change, you'll have to regenerate the completion script and source it again.","title":"--completion: Generating a completion script "},{"location":"using-cli/#-help-getting-help","text":"Let say you have a command line tool named widget that was made with Fire. How do you use this Fire CLI? The simplest way to get started is to run widget -- --help . This will give you usage information for your CLI. You can always append -- --help to any Fire command in order to get usage information for that command and any subcommands. Additionally, help will be displayed if you hit an error using Fire. For example, if you try to pass too many or too few arguments to a function, then help will be displayed. Similarly, if you try to access a member that does not exist, or if you index into a list with too high an index, then help will be displayed. The displayed help shows information about which Python component your command corresponds to, as well as usage information for how to extend that command.","title":"--help: Getting help "},{"location":"using-cli/#-trace-getting-a-fire-trace","text":"In order to understand what is happening when you call Python Fire, it can be useful to request a trace. This is done via the --trace flag, e.g. widget whack 5 -- --trace . A trace provides step by step information about how the Fire command was executed. In includes which actions were taken, starting with the initial component, leading to the final component represented by the command. A trace is also shown alongside the help if your Fire command reaches an error.","title":"--trace: Getting a Fire trace "},{"location":"using-cli/#-separator-changing-the-separator","text":"As described in Calling a Function , you can use a separator argument when writing a command that corresponds to calling a function. The separator will cause the function to be evaluated or the class to be instantiated using only the arguments left of the separator. Arguments right of the separator will then be applied to the result of the function call or to the instantiated object. The default separator is - . If you want to supply the string \"-\" as an argument, then you will have to change the separator. You can choose a new separator by supplying the --separator flag to Fire. Here's an example to demonstrate separator usage. Let's say you have a function that takes a variable number of args, and you want to call that function, and then upper case the result. Here's how to do it: # Here's the Python function def display(arg1, arg2='!'): return arg1 + arg2 # Here's what you can do from Bash (Note: the default separator is the hyphen -) display hello # hello! display hello upper # helloupper display hello - upper # HELLO! display - SEP upper -- --separator SEP # -! Notice how in the third and fourth lines, the separator caused the display function to be called with the default value for arg2. In the fourth example, we change the separator to the string \"SEP\" so that we can pass '-' as an argument.","title":"--separator: Changing the separator "},{"location":"using-cli/#-verbose-verbose-usage","text":"Adding the -v or --verbose flag turns on verbose mode. This will eg reveal private members in the usage string. Often these members will not actually be usable from the command line tool. As such, verbose mode should be considered a debugging tool, but not fully supported yet.","title":"--verbose: Verbose usage "}]}
